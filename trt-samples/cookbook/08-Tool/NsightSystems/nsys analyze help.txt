usage: nsys analyze [<args>] <input-file>

    <input-file> : A .qdrep or .sqlite file to be analyzed.

    <args> :
        -h, --help
            Print help message.

        --help-rules [<rule_name>|ALL]
            With no argument, list available rules with a short description.
            If a rule name is given, a more detailed
            explanation of the rule is displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a
            more detailed explanation of all available rules is displayed.

        --sqlite <file.sqlite>
            Specify the SQLite export filename. If this file exists, it will
            be used. If this file doesn't exist (or if --force-export was given)
            this file will be created from the specified QDREP file before
            rule processing. This option cannot be used if the specified
            input file is also an SQLite file.

        -r, --rule <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>
            Specify the rule(s) to generate, including any arguments. This
            option may be used multiple times. Multiple rules may also be
            specified using a comma-separated list.

            If no rules are given, the following will be used as the
            default rule set:

              async-memcpy-pageable
              sync-memcpy
              sync-memset
              sync-api
              gpu-starvation
              gpu-low-utilization

            See --help-rules for a list of built-in rules, along with more
            information on each rule.

        --force-export [true|false]
            Force a re-export of the SQLite file from the specified QDREP file,
            even if an SQLite file already exists.

        -q, --quiet
            Do not display verbose messages.
