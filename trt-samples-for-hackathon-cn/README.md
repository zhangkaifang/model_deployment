# NVIDIA TensorRT Tutorial repository

This repository is aimed at NVIDIA TensorRT beginners and developers. We provide TensorRT-related learning and reference materials, code examples, and summaries of the annual TensorRT Hackathon competition information.

本仓库面向 NVIDIA TensorRT 初学者和开发者,提供了 TensorRT 相关学习资料和参考资料、丰富的代码范例，以及每年举办一次的 TensorRT Hackathon 的比赛信息

## Introduction of each directory

+ Hackathon, a summary of the annual China TensorRT Hackathon competition information, including competition introduction, related resources of competition topics, reference implementation (which can be regarded as an optimization case of a classic model).

+ cookbook, a TensorRT Recipe containing rich examples of TensorRT code, such as API usage, process of building and running models in TensorRT using native APIs or Parsers, writing TensorRT Plugins, optimization of computation graph, and more advanced techniques of TensorRT.

+ old, other TensorRT sample codes which will be gradually put into the cookbook in the future.

## Resource

+ MNIST Dataset and ONNX file of Hackathon2022 competition: [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14HNCFbySLXndumicFPD-Ww), Extraction code (提取码): gpq2
