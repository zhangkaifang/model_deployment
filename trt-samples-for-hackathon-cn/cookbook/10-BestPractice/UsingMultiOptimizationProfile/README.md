## Introduction

+ The example code tries two dynamic range strategies for the same model. The first (model-1. plan) uses an entire Optimization Profile, and the second (model-2. plan) uses two segmented Optimization Profiles for large and small shapes, and then tests the performance under different input data shapes

## Result

+ The overall performance will be better with multiple Optimization Profiles
